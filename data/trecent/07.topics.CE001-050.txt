<query>invasive plant species</query>
<narr>
CSIRO research is helping to manage the increasing threat and damage from invasive alien species. CSIRO research areas include the risk assessments of potential exotic pests, designing crops resistant to known threats, border protection and management of impacts and threats from invasive species.

<query>polymer bank notes</query>
<narr>
CSIRO helped develop the worldâs first polymer banknote, creating the most secure currency in the world. CSIRO's expertise in polymer and synthetic chemistry was used to develop a non-fibrous and non-porous plastic film, which the banknotes are printed on. This material gives high tear resistance and a longer lifetime than paper.

<query>atmosphere</query>
<narr>
CSIRO research investigates three main areas relating to the topic of living atmosphere. CSIRO seeks to develop its air-quality science with maximum community benefit for a healthier atmosphere, to understand the composition and sources of our changing atmosphere and thirdly, to understand the land and atmosphere systems which will inform and improve natural resource management and climate predictions.

<query>air pollution</query>
<narr>
CSIRO atmospheric scientists are measuring, monitoring and analysing air pollution. CSIRO's air-quality science provides understanding of air pollutants, guidance for managing air quality and improved management tools. The Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station, located in remote north-western Tasmania, provides vital information about changes to the atmospheric composition of the Southern Hemisphere.
